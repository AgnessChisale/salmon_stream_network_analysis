Stream segments were converted to routes and stored in a feature dataset. Topology rules were used to identify where dams and the island boundary intersect the stream routes, producing dam junction and ocean junction point layers. Slope gradient and stream order were extracted along routes using linear referencing and combined into a single overlay event table. A trace network was built to identify stream segments reachable from the ocean without crossing a dam.
